#### Note
use `git clone --recursive https://github.com/GrisWoldDiablo/GameEngineTut` to properly clone the project.

`--recursive` will get all the submodules initialized also.

Then run the bat file to create the visual studio project 

The project need to be compiled/builded twice because the first time, the post build command, dll copy, will fail since the copy folder does not exist.
